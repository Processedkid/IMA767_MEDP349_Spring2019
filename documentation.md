# Documentation Guidelines

Keeping good documentation of your work is one of the most useful and under appreciated skills. Good documentation paints a clear and full picture of your work - the final product is just as important as the process you took to create it. Documentation is helpful for bringing attention to your work and sharing how you made something, but it's also important for helping you to retrace your steps and remember what you did when you revisit the project months or years later. This is especially important for physical work.

When introducing your work, write for a broad audience. If someone on the internet randomly came across your documentation, would they have a clear idea of what it is? What it does? How it works? Your general description should be easy to understand regardless of the reader's technical experience.

You should get more technical as you go into the details of your project. For example, if someone on the internet was interested in making a project similar to yours, would your documentation provide enough info and resources to give them insight into how they might accomplish something similar on a technical level?

## The Final Product
* What is it? What does it do?
  * Include photos, videos, screen captures, etc. If it's interactive, show the interaction with a video.
  * How does it work?
    * Include your circuit, technical diagrams, code, etc.
    * Code must be [well-commented](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StyleGuide).

## Process
* Document your project as you go, from start to finish.
  * Take plenty of notes, sketches, photos, videos, screen captures, etc. and hold onto them. You can always trash them later but it's much harder to do these things after the fact.
  * Do this as soon as you have working prototypes to make it easy to backtrack if something stops working. Don't be the one saying, "It was working yesterday!" when you get to class and your project stops working - if you've been diligent about documentation, at least you'll have something to show for all your hard work.
  * Photographs of working setups will help you fix your project if it stops working as expected.
  * How did you come up with the idea? Were you inspired by specific projects, artists, etc.?
  * Early sketches, prototypes, etc. are great to look back on and provide depth to your project.
  * Show the tools and materials you used.
  * Discuss challenges, design decisions, epiphanies, etc.
  * Provide citations when you get ideas, inspiration or technical assistance from elsewhere. It's normal with complex technical projects to build upon the work of others, whether with code libraries or circuit diagrams. Make sure to give credit when using someone else's code or make clear which aspects are your original contributions.

## Conclusions
* What still needs to be done?
* What worked well?
* What didn't work well? What you would do differently?
* Future directions

## Embedding Images in a Github Wiki post

If you know how to upload your images to an online host, you can just follow step 3 to embed them in your post. Otherwise you can follow these steps to upload your images to a Github repository.
* [Create a Github repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) for your coursework (if you haven't already done so).
* [Upload your images to your Github repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/)
* [Embed your image in your post](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-images-to-wikis/)

## Sharing Video

Videos cannot be embedded in the Github wiki so upload your video to a site like Vimeo or YouTube and include a link to your video in your post.

## Sharing Code

You have two options when it comes to uploading and sharing your code. I would highly recommend storing all of your code in a Github Repository (option 1). Just make sure you provide a link to it in your documentation.

1. [Managing Files in a Github Repository](https://help.github.com/categories/managing-files-in-a-repository/)
2. [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/)

Post your Arduino code with a ".ino" filename ending so that Github will be highlight the syntax correctly. You can also use \`\`\`cpp markdown in a post to indicate to Github that you're posting code to be interpreted as C++.
